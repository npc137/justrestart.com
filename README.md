# Just Restart

**Your computer needs a fresh start too!**

A simple website explaining why you should restart your computer periodically, inspired by the wonderful [nohello.net](https://nohello.net/).

## The Problem

Many people avoid restarting their computers, leading to:
- Memory leaks and performance degradation
- Accumulated temporary files
- Incomplete system updates
- Overheating and loud fans
- General sluggishness

## The Solution

Regular restarts provide:
- Fresh memory allocation
- Completed system updates
- Cleared cache and temporary files
- Reset system processes
- Cool, quiet operation

## Features

- Clean, modern design inspired by nohello.net
- Interactive typed text animation
- Responsive layout that works on all devices
- Easter egg: type "restart" for a special surprise! 
- System message mockups showing before/after scenarios
- Educational content about computer maintenance

## Tech Stack

- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- [Typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/) for text animation
- Google Fonts (Lato)
- No build process - just open `index.html`

## For Mac Admins 🍎

Managing a fleet of Macs that haven't been restarted since the last macOS update? Your users probably think "restart" is just a fancy button that does nothing! 

Check out [Renew](https://github.com/SecondSonConsulting/Renew) - a script that can help automate restarts across your Mac fleet. Because sometimes you need to be the parent who says "bedtime!" to hundreds of computers at once.

*Warning: May cause sudden increases in user productivity and mysterious disappearances of "my computer is slow" tickets.*
