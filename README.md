# Just Restart

**Your computer needs therapy (and a restart)!**

A delightfully humorous website explaining why you should restart your computer periodically, inspired by [nohello.net](https://nohello.net/). Think of it as digital intervention for your overworked, sleep-deprived computer that's been running since the last ice age.

## The Problem (aka Digital Hoarding)

Many people avoid restarting their computers, leading to tragic consequences:
- Memory leaks accumulate like dishes in a college dorm sink (but somehow grosser)
- Temporary files pile up like Amazon packages during Black Friday shopping sprees
- System processes become as responsive as a DMV clerk at 4:59 PM
- Updates remain incomplete, leaving security gaps wider than your browser history
- Your computer runs so hot it could double as a space heater (but way louder and angrier)
- General sluggishness that makes dial-up internet look speedy

*It's like trying to function after surviving on energy drinks and spite for three weeks straight.*

## The Solution (Digital Phoenix Rising)

Regular restarts provide your computer with:
- Fresh memory allocation - like a digital Marie Kondo session
- Completed system updates and security patches (because vulnerability is so last Tuesday)
- Cleared temporary files and cache (digital spring cleaning, but faster)
- Reset network connections and system processes (like hitting the refresh button on life)
- Cool, quiet operation that won't wake your cat at 3 AM
- Performance that makes your computer purr instead of scream

*Treat your computer like a houseplant - a little regular care goes a long way.*

## Features (What Makes This Site Special)

- Clean, modern design inspired by nohello.net
- Interactive typed text animation (because static text is for quitters)
- Responsive layout that works on all devices (unlike your unrestarted computer)
- Easter egg: type "restart" for a special surprise! (We won't spoil it, but it's delightful)
- Educational content about computer maintenance disguised as comedy therapy
- Witty analogies that make technical concepts actually entertaining
- Typography that doesn't have orphaned words (because we care about the details)

## For Mac Admins üçé

Managing a fleet of Macs that haven't been restarted since the last macOS update? Your users probably think "restart" is just a fancy button that does nothing! 

Check out [Renew](https://github.com/SecondSonConsulting/Renew) - a script that gently (or not so gently) reminds users to restart on a defined schedule. It respects user agency by never forcing a restart without consent - think of it as the polite but persistent friend who reminds you to go to bed instead of dragging you there.

*Warning: May cause sudden increases in user productivity and mysterious disappearances of "my computer is slow" tickets.*

## Tech Stack (The Good Stuff)

- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no framework bloat, just like your computer after a restart)
- [Typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/) for text animation
- Google Fonts (Lato) for typography that doesn't make your eyes cry
- No build process - just open `index.html` and you're golden
- Semantic HTML for accessibility (because everyone deserves good restart advice)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts that don't break on weird screen sizes
- Non-breaking spaces to eliminate orphaned words (typography nerds, rejoice!)

## Local Development (It's Refreshingly Simple)

1. Clone this repository (like cloning your computer's memory, but easier)
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (any browser, we're not picky)
3. That's it! No build process, no dependency hell, no existential crisis

*Seriously, it's so simple you might think something's wrong. Nothing is wrong. This is just how web development used to be before we complicated everything.*

## Deployment (Host It Anywhere)

This site can be deployed to any static hosting service (because it's just files, not a complex application):
- GitHub Pages (free and easy, like restarting your computer)
- Netlify (drag, drop, done)
- Vercel (deploy faster than your computer boots up)
- Surge.sh (for the nostalgic developers)
- Or any web server that can serve static files (literally any of them)

*Pro tip: The deployment process is simpler than explaining to your relatives why they need to restart their computers.*

## Contributing (Join the Restart Revolution)

Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests! We welcome:
- Bug reports (ironic, considering the site is about fixing computer problems)
- Feature suggestions (more humor? better analogies? we're listening)
- Typography improvements (orphan elimination is serious business)
- Performance optimizations (because even a site about restarting should be fast)
- Accessibility enhancements (everyone deserves good restart advice)

*Just remember to save your work before restarting your development environment!*

**Remember:** Always save your work before restarting! Your computer gets a fresh start, but your unsaved document goes to the digital graveyard (and nobody wants to explain that to their boss)! üíæ‚ú®
